It explains the latest technological advances in this field, especially in the context of different types of solar panels, namely, photovoltaic (also known as PV), thermal collectors, photovoltaic-thermal (known as PV/T) panels and concentrating solar panels. Specifically, the paper examines how each of the technologies analysed operates to produce heat and electrical power, how to improve the energy efficiency and which technology provides the best system efficiencies and fastest return on investment. Finally, it also assesses the extent to which the exploitation of renewable energy sources and incentives to achieve energy efficiency is supported by the European regulatory framework and policies.},

  abstract = {Die vorliegende Arbeit behandelt spinabhängige Transport- und Rekombinationsprozesse in Solarzellen. Im Rahmen dieser Studie zum Einfluss von paramagnetischen Defektzuständen, die als Einfang- und Rekombinationszentren für optisch erzeugte Ladungsträger wirken, wurden drei unterschiedliche Arten von Solarzellen untersucht. Hierzu wurde die Messmethode der elektrisch detektierten magnetischen Resonanz (EDMR) verwendet. Insbesondere wurde die gepulste (p) EDMR bezüglich ihrer Detektionsempfindlichkeit optimiert, wodurch pEDMR-Messungen an vollständig prozessierten Bauelementen im Temperaturbereich von 10 K bis Raumtemperatur ermöglicht wurden. Darüber hinaus wurden instrumentelle Erweiterungen mit dem Ziel vorgenommen, pEDMR-Messungen bei unterschiedlichen Resonanzfrequenzen durchführen zu können. In Hocheffizienz-Solarzellen aus mit Wasserstoff versetztem amorphen Silizium (a-Si:H) und kristallinem Silizium (c-Si) konnten Rekombinationsprozesse über Defektzustände an der a-Si:H/c-Si Grenzfläche erstmalig direkt elektrisch detektiert werden. Die Identifikation der Defekte erfolgte anhand ihrer Orientierung bezüglich der c-Si Oberfläche. In Dünnschicht-Solarzellen aus mit Wasserstoff versetztem mikrokristallinen Silizium (μc-Si:H) ist die Situation komplexer. Zum einen ist das Material selbst heterogen und ungeordnet. Zum anderen bestehen die Solarzellen aus mehreren Silizium-Schichten mit unterschiedlicher Dotierung und Mikrostruktur. Zur Identifikation der spinabhängigen Signale sowie deren Zuordnung zu den einzelnen Schichten wurde die Struktur der Solarzelle systematisch verändert. Darüber hinaus wurden spektral überlappende Signale anhand ihrer unterschiedlichen Zeitstruktur voneinander getrennt. Infolge der instrumentellen Optimierungen konnten erstmalig pEDMR-Messungen an siliziumbasierten Solarzellen bei Raumtemperatur durchgeführt werden. In organischen Heterostruktur-Solarzellen basierend auf einer Mischung aus MEH- PPV und PCBM existieren zwei unterschiedliche spinabhängige Prozesse, die an Verlustmechanismen im Solarzellenbetrieb beteiligt sind. Beide Prozesse, nämlich die Rekombination von Polaronen-Paaren sowie die Bildung von Bipolaronen, wurden zuvor mit Hilfe der “continuous wave” (cw) EDMR untersucht. Eine eindeutige Zuordnung der gefundenen cwEDMR-Signale zu den zugrunde liegenden Prozessen war jedoch bisher nicht möglich, weil beide genannten Mechanismen zu nicht unterscheidbaren cwEDMR-Spektren führen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnte gezeigt werden, dass durch die elektrische Detektion von Rabi-Oszillationen im “spin-locking”-Regime in Verbindung mit Simulationen eine Trennung von beiden Prozessen möglich ist.},

  abstract = {Hyperfine couplings play a central role in electron paramagnetic resonance. They arise from the magnetic interaction of unpaired electrons with nuclear spins and provide one of the most important sources of information from EPR spectra. In this article, the hyperfine interaction and its implication for the shape of EPR spectra are discussed. Starting from a derivation of the general hyperfine spin Hamiltonian, three regimes for EPR spectra are distinguished based on the relative size of the electron Zeeman interaction with respect to the nuclear Zeeman and the hyperfine interactions. Representative examples are provided for EPR spectra of diluted paramagnetic centers in liquids and in the frozen solution state. In the latter case, the combined effects of g and hyperfine anisotropy can be disentangled in EPR spectra recorded at different microwave frequencies. Semiempirical rules permit to rationalize the observed size of isotropic hyperfine couplings and provide a simple tool for assignments of EPR spectra. Finally, large hyperfine couplings can give rise to subtle effects in EPR spectra at conventional microwave frequencies and fields (X-band, 0.34 T). Particularly, hyperfine anisotropy can affect transition probabilities, a fact which is at the basis for several advanced EPR experiments.},

Distant hyperfine involving the background hydrogen present in the material is found to broaden the resonance in a-Si:H. The broadening is proportional to the square-root of the hydrogen concentration and reaches 1 G at 10 at.\% hydrogen. The lineshape is more Lorentz-like in the degraded than in the as-grown or annealed states. An identical EDMR signal intensity D srs is observed for a-Si:H using spectrometers working at 434 MHz, 9 and 34 GHz, indicating that the signal intensity is independent of the Zeeman splitting. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Among solar power technologies, solar photovoltaics (PV) are the most widely deployed, providing 0.87\% of the world's electricity in 2013 and sustaining a compound annual growth rate in cumulative installed capacity of 43\% since 2000. Given the massive scale of deployment needed, this article examines potential limits to PV deployment at the terawatt scale, emphasizing constraints on the use of commodity and PV-critical materials. We propose material complexity as a guiding framework for classifying PV technologies, and we analyze three core themes that focus future research and development: efficiency, materials use, and manufacturing complexity and cost.},

A qualitative model for the density of states distribution in the energy gap is developed which is dominated by two kinds of dangling bonds and bandtail states at both band edges. In phosphorus-doped samples, ESR reveals a metal–insulator transition at a phosphorus concentration of 4 Â 1018 cmÀ3. Light-induced ESR and electrically detected magnetic resonance show that at low temperatures recombination is dominated by tunneling transitions from the bandtail states into neutral dangling bonds. Apparently, at higher temperatures, direct capture from conducting states prevails. The results are discussed considering the heterogeneous structure of this material.},

  abstract = {Recently, several parameters relevant for modeling crystalline silicon solar cells were improved or revised, e.g., the international standard solar spectrum or properties of silicon such as the intrinsic recombination rate and the intrinsic carrier concentration. In this study, we analyzed the influence of these improved state-of-the-art parameters on the limiting efficiency for crystalline silicon solar cells under 1-sun illumination at 25 ◦C, by following the narrow-base approximation to model ideal solar cells. We also considered bandgap narrowing, which was not addressed so far with respect to efficiency limitation. The new calculations that are presented in this study result in a maximum theoretical efficiency of 29.43\% for a 110-μm-thick solar cell made of undoped silicon. A systematic calculation of the I–V parameters as a function of the doping concentration and the cell thickness together with an analysis of the loss current at maximum power point provides further insight into the intrinsic limitations of silicon solar cells.},

After an initial comparison of pulse EPR to CW EPR, the basics of pulses and their effects on electron spins are discussed. Then, the basic pulse sequences (one, two, and three pulses) and the associated signals (free induction decay, primary echo, and stimulated echo) are introduced. The effects of spectral, pulse, and resonator bandwidths are considered together with the resulting orientation and transition selection. Non-coherent effects including longitudinal and transverse spin relaxation, phase memory time, spectral diffusion, and instantaneous diffusion are discussed. After a brief explanation of the workings of a pulse EPR spectrometer based on a block diagram and discussion of resonator ringdown, deadtime, and phase cycling, this introduction concludes with some practical aspects relevant to performing pulse EPR experiments.},

The magnitude of spin-dependent changes in conductivity or luminescence is outlined following the ideas developed by Lepine and Kaplan, Solomon, and Mott. Undoped a-Si:H serves as a model system for the discussion of recombination mechanisms in disordered semiconductors, in particular distant electron±hole pair recombination, recombination via excitonic pairs (spin triplets), and via dangling bond defects. Electrical detection of magnetic resonance at low magnetic ®elds (\$0.0155 T) can be used to study the hyper®ne interaction between dangling bonds and hydrogen, and the results are discussed with respect to microscopic models for metastability phenomena in amorphous silicon. Optical detection of magnetic resonance in Si-based amorphous alloys with Ge, C, N, or O con®rm the importance of dangling bonds as non-radiative recombination centers. In wide band-gap alloys, excitonic triplet states appear to be the dominant radiative recombination channel. In addition, recent results concerning spin-dependent transport in microcrystalline Si as well as new experimental approaches for the detection of magnetic resonance via noise or capacitance measurements are presented.

  abstract = {Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells represent a promising technological approach toward higher photovoltaic efficiencies and lower fabrication cost. While the device physics of SHJ solar cells has been studied extensively in the past, the ways in which nanoscopic electronic processes such as charge-carrier generation, recombination, trapping, and percolation affect SHJ device properties macroscopically are yet to be fully understood. We report the study of atomic-scale current percolation at state-of-the-art a-Si:H/ c-Si heterojunction solar cells at room temperature, revealing the profound complexity of electronic SHJ interface processes. Using conduction atomic force microscopy, it is shown that the macroscopic current−voltage characteristics of SHJ solar cells are governed by the average of local nanometer-sized percolation pathways associated with bandtail states of the doped a-Si:H selective contact leading to above bandgap local photovoltages (VOlocC) as high as 1.2 V (eVOlocC {$>$} EgSaip). This is not in violation of photovoltaic device physics but a consequence of the nature of nanometer-scale charge percolation pathways that originate from trap-assisted tunneling causing dark leakage current. We show that the broad distribution of nanoscopic local photovoltage is a direct consequence of randomly trapped charges at a-Si:H dangling bond defects, which lead to strong local potential fluctuations and induce random telegraph noise of the dark current.},

We show that two techniques are sensitive to and can probe structural information about the atomic scale defect centers that are responsible for leakage currents in technologically important thin films. We investigate leakage currents in a-SiN:H thin films with both electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) and near-zero field magnetoresistance (NZFMR). In all measurements, the linewidth of the EDMR/NZFMR response is a function of the N/Si ratio of the film; the width provides information about the leakage defect structure. The NZFMR measurement provides the possibility of combining the sensitivity and at least some of the analytical power of EDMR with the simplicity of an apparatus that could potentially be implemented during fabrication of devices.},
